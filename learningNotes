AdvanceObjects & Functions:
Objects are created in two ways 1) by using a function constructor 2) by using a Object.create() method.
functions can be pass as parameters.
functions can be returned from another function.
a function that invokes an another function is called as a call back function.
IFFI --> instead of creting a function to limit the scope of the variables outside best was is by just creating an iffi (function(name) {console.log(name)})().
Closures: An inner function has access to the variables of the outside function even if the outer function is returned (functions that return functions..)
if this is not pointed to an object then it refers to the window object.
CALL METHOD ---> for example john has a method which uses this to display its fiends. but you want to call the john method but set this to different object the use this method.
example: john.presentation.call(avinashobj,parameters)
APPLY METHOD ---> use this if the arguments are array.
BIND METHOD ---> is used same as above but only a subset of parameters set initially..
